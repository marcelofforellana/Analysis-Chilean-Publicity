# Analysis-Chilean-Advertising


The image body perception in advertising is important, whether in Cultural, Sociolog-ical or Marketing terms. However, analyses in the literature tend to be hard and costly methods to scale. The contribution of this work is to offer an integrated and scalable model of image analysis using Machine Learning.
Specifically, this work will be responsible for collecting, measuring and analyzing physical aspects of individuals appearing in the advertising in dimensions such as Body Type, Ethnicity, Age and Gender.To measure morphological and physical aspects of the subjets appearing in advertisements, an algorithm was developed using Python language with three main task: 1) Web Scraping: for the image extraction, 2) Digital Image Processing: for edition, filtering and identification of advertising images, 3) Physical attribute recognition: for physical characteristics extraction of the individuals through Convolutional Neural Networks pretrained algorithms.
